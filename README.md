# Dashboards
This repository is meant for displaying the dashboards that I have created.

## E-COMMERCE DASHBOARD IN TABLEAU
I have used sales data of an e-commerce company to create an interactive dashboard in tableau.
I have created various calculated fields including Level of Detail (LOD) calculations and used line charts, bar charts and bump charts to visualize the data.
I have also added filters to make the dashboard more interactive.

## Excel Dashboard
In the Bike-Buyers Dashboard, I have taken the Bike-Buyers dataset from [Dataset Link](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa2xkMWQzTEJDMmxHRjZMQ1dEa0poQkxlSWFEQXxBQ3Jtc0tsQWd6R3Y1R1Z0RWl5MVcySFVzRWoxcWZvUU9xT3Jvcl9xUmNvNGZHSzg4Uk9zbzN3NUN0ZFQ2VjdjdmlEWVljOG9vUnJqZEJoVGtzcjg1aUFZaW9VZ0FPLWJoaThQYTkzQmZrcl9KMnRxUHhQR0h1QQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FAlexTheAnalyst%2FExcel-Tutorial%2Fblob%2Fmain%2FExcel%2520Project%2520Dataset.xlsx&v=opJgMj1IUrc). 
I performed Data Cleaning and created a Dashboard for Visualization in MS-EXCEL.
