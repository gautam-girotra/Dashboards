# Dashboards
This repository is meant for displaying the dashboards that I have created.

## IPL DASHBOARD IN TABLEAU
I have used the Indian Premier League(IPL) data from 2008-2022 to create an interactive dashboard in tableau.
I have created various worksheets that perform different calculations . I have also used bar charts and donut charts to visualize the data based on what decision the captain took after winning the toss.
I have added a season filter to let the viewer check the statitsics for the season they are specifically interested in.

## E-COMMERCE DASHBOARD IN TABLEAU
I have used sales data of an e-commerce company to create an interactive dashboard in tableau.
I have created various calculated fields including Level of Detail (LOD) calculations and used line charts, bar charts and bump charts to visualize the data.
I have also added filters to make the dashboard more interactive.
